Background
In Nodejs, there are 3 different ways to take input.
Command line arguments
Environment variables
readLine function
In this assignment, you will practice how to take input in these ways. We will take a name as input (e.g. Ravi) and print Hello Ravi.
Instructions
Create three different files.
readCommandLineArguments.js
This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) as a command line argument and print a greeting Hello Ravi
readEnvVariable.js
This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) through an environment variable called USERNAME and print a greeting Hello Ravi
readFromLine.js
This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) from the user and print a greeting Hello Ravi

Unix or Mac - export USERNAME=Ravi
Run the command node readEnvVariable.js
It should print Hello Ravi on the console
Repeat it with 2 other names and it should print the correct greeting
